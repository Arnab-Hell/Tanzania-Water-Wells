Tanzania faces a water and sanitation crisis that affects its population of 59 million. About 28% of this population, around 16 million people, lack access to safe water. Additionally, a substantial 73%, or approximately 44 million people, lack access to properly managed household sanitation facilities. 
These conditions result in significant challenges, especially for women and girls who spend extended periods fetching water over long distances. Challenges include insufficient funding for planned government initiatives, population growth, and the impact of climate change, leading to extreme weather events. 
These difficulties are particularly burdensome for those living in poverty. Ensuring safe water access, especially within homes, is now more critical than ever for families across Tanzania.
